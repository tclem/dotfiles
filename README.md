# tclem and his dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

## Install

``` sh
git clone git://github.com/tclem/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

A .zshrc is setup for you, but it will look for and source a .localrc
which is where you should put stuff you don't want checked into a public
repo.

## Credit where credit is due

The original version of these came from [Zach
Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), but I have ripped and torn
them beyond recognition. Many of my zsh tricks come from
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) which is well
worth checking out in it's own right.
